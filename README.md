Rails4 Bootstrap
================

**A simple rails4 starting point**


Description
-----------

Rails4 Bootstrap supports:

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Compass](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass)


## What is the purpose of Rails4 Bootstrap?

I created Rails4 Bootstrap in order to have a consistent starting point for my rails projects. I like having Haml, Sass and Compass available to me in every project, likewise jQuery makes its way into every production as well. A number of helpful rake tasks have also been included.


## How to use

1. Fork it.
2. Rename.
3. Implement your code.
